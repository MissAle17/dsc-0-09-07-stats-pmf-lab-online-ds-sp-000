    "The class size paradox describes the apparent contradictory findings where a total allocation of resources is fixed. Differences result in the perception of events based on whether we consider events from the point of view of the typical event or the typical person participating in an event. Such varying distributions can have important consequences for data analysis. pmfs can help resolve some of these situations as we shall see below \n",
